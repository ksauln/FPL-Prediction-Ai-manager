# FPL Expected Points Pipeline

Automated Fantasy Premier League analytics pipeline that ingests raw data, engineers features, trains ML models, updates bias adjustments, and outputs next gameweek projections alongside an optimized squad selection. A companion Streamlit interface (“FPL Optimization Toolkit”) visualizes the official next gameweek, confidence-aware predictions, user squad comparisons, and transfer recommendations.

---

## 1. System Overview

The pipeline is structured so each stage feeds the next while persisting intermediate artefacts for later inspection or incremental reruns:

1. **Logging/bootstrap** – capture run metadata and initialise logging.
2. **External data ingestion**
   - Official FPL API (bootstrap, fixtures, per-player histories).
   - Optional historical CSVs from the `vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League` GitHub repo.
3. **Feature engineering** – derive rolling windows, lags, opponent strength context, set-piece indicators, and bias features.
4. **Model selection and training** – compare multiple estimator families (histogram gradient boosting, random forest, MLP, XGBoost with optional GPU support), fit each candidate, and retain both the selected pair and the full set for ensembling.
5. **Prediction** – score every fitted model, average their expected-point outputs into an ensemble forecast, apply fixture multipliers, and attach confidence diagnostics.
6. **Evaluation & bias update** – score the most recently completed gameweek, update EMA-based player and positional residual corrections.
7. **Squad optimization** – construct the best XI plus bench via mixed-integer optimization subject to FPL constraints.
8. **Outputs** – write predictions, squads, residuals, and logs to disk.

## 3. Installation & Execution

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py              # runs the full pipeline
```

To include historical CSVs from the vaastav archive, clone the repo into `data/external/Fantasy-Premier-League` (matching the default path in `config.py`). The pipeline will automatically fall back to API-only data if those files are absent.

Adjustments to paths, feature toggles, and model settings live in `fplmodel/config.py`.

### 3.1 Gameweek Overrides & Replay
- Single backdated run: `python main.py --override-last-finished-gw 4 --override-next-gw 5`
- Sequential rebuild (example GW5–7):

  ```bash
  python main.py --force-refetch --replay-start-gw 5 --replay-end-gw 7
  ```

- Only the first replay iteration honours `--force-refetch`; later runs reuse cached data.
- Overrides let you reconstruct history so EMA biases in `models/state.json` evolve just as they would week by week.
- Without overrides the pipeline relies on live `bootstrap-static` metadata to infer the current, next, and last finished gameweeks automatically.

### 3.2 Generating Future Projections
The Streamlit transfer recommender expects prediction files for the next horizon (e.g., GW8–GW12). After running the live pipeline, replay the upcoming gameweeks:

```bash
python main.py --force-refetch --replay-start-gw 8 --replay-end-gw 12
```

This writes `outputs/predictions_gw8.csv` through `outputs/predictions_gw12.csv`, along with best XI JSON/PNG artefacts, enabling multi-week app projections.

## 4. Detailed Pipeline Walkthrough

### 4.1 Logging and Preparation
- `main.py` initialises a run-specific logger via `fplmodel.logging_utils.configure_run_logger`.
- `get_current_and_last_finished_gw` determines the next/open gameweek and the most recently completed one (using `events` from bootstrap).
- If `MAX_TRAIN_GW` is set, it caps the training horizon.

### 4.2 Data Ingestion
1. **Bootstrap static** (`fetch_bootstrap_static`)  
   Yields player metadata, team information, chip stats, and events.
2. **Fixtures** (`fetch_fixtures_all`)  
   Full schedule including future double/blank GWs.
3. **Player histories** (`bulk_fetch_player_histories`)  
   Pulls per-match history arrays for each player.  
   - Configurable `PLAYER_HISTORY_SEASONS_BACK` determines how many prior seasons to request via the API.
   - Files cached under `data/raw/player_<id>.json`.

4. **External history ingestion** (`external_history.load_external_histories`)  
   Optionally attaches vaastav CSV seasons listed in `EXTERNAL_HISTORY_SEASONS`.

### 4.3 Data Cleaning
- `data_cleaning.normalize_bootstrap` normalises bootstrap structures into pandas DataFrames (`elements`, `teams`, `events`).
- `data_cleaning.build_master_history` merges API histories plus optional external data into a unified match-level table.

### 4.4 Feature Engineering
- `features.build_training_and_pred_frames` produces:
  - Lagged + rolling windows for goals, assists, clean sheets, expected metrics.
  - Opponent strength metrics (team and opponent rolling form, expected goals conceded, set-piece roles).
  - Bias features (player- and position-level residual signals).
  - Binary indicators for availability, home/away, double/blank weeks.
  - Training metadata (season/gameweek timestamps) for time-aware CV & weighting.
- `expand_for_double_gw` multiplies expected points by fixture counts for double/blank adjustments while keeping per-model diagnostics.

### 4.5 Model Selection & Training (`model.train_models`)
- Candidate families: histogram gradient boosting (sklearn), random forest, MLP, XGBoost (optional GPU).
- Optional hyperparameter tuning (`ENABLE_HYPERPARAM_TUNING`) explores search spaces defined in `config.py`.
- Chronological TimeSeriesSplit CV replaces random folds whenever metadata permits, preventing look-ahead leakage.
- Per-season sample weights decay older campaigns (configurable via `SEASON_WEIGHT_DECAY` / `SEASON_WEIGHT_MIN`).
- Saves tuned models and metadata to `models/`.
- Logs feature importances (`log_model_feature_weights`) for inspection.

### 4.6 Prediction (`model.predict_expected_points`)
- Scores every player across the selected regressors/classifiers.
- Averages the raw outputs across models, re-applies EMA bias corrections (`player_bias`, `position_bias`), and clips at zero to produce the ensemble column used throughout the rest of the pipeline.
- Applies double/blank gameweek fixture multipliers. Double-gameweek players can therefore have materially higher one-week projections.
- Adds confidence diagnostics:
  - `start_probability` – classifier-estimated chance of a player reaching starter-level minutes.
  - `confidence_score` / `confidence_level` – blended signal from model agreement, player availability, start probability, and recent-data reliability.
  - `expected_points_lower_80` / `expected_points_upper_80` – approximate 80% expected-points interval.
- Outputs `outputs/predictions_gw<N>.csv` containing per-model raw/corrected predictions, ensemble `expected_points`, fixture multipliers, and confidence fields.

### 4.7 Evaluation & Bias Update (`evaluation.evaluate_last_finished_gw_and_update_state`)
- Reconstructs “gw-1” feature rows for players who played in `last_finished_gw`.
- Predicts that finished GW, compares to actual total points.
- Computes residuals and updates `state.json` via exponential moving average (`EMA_ALPHA`).
  - Separate EMA per player and per position keeps future predictions calibrated.

### 4.8 Squad Optimization (`team_picker.pick_best_xi`)
- Formulates an integer linear program using PuLP:
  - Decision variables for each player (start, bench, captain).
  - Constraints: budget, formation options (`FORMATION_OPTIONS`), positional minimums, max three per club, total squad size (15) and bench order.
- Produces:
  - Starting XI with captaincy applied.
  - Bench ordering.
  - Expected-point totals with and without captain.
- Optionally annotates fixtures on the squad objects.

### 4.9 Artifact Generation
- Saves:
  - Predictions: `outputs/predictions_gw<N>.csv`.
  - Starting XI / Bench CSVs.
  - Full squad JSON.
  - Squad image (if `display.create_best_xi_graphic` succeeds).
  - Residuals CSV for `last_finished_gw`.
- Maintains run-specific logs under `logs/`.

## 5. Streamlit “FPL Optimization Toolkit”

Launch the UI after running the pipeline at least once:

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The app auto-loads fixtures and prediction files from `outputs/`, checks live FPL `bootstrap-static` event metadata, and falls back to local cached metadata if the network is unavailable. Session state preserves your selections across pages so you can navigate without re-entering teams.

### 5.1 Screenshots

Transfer recommender setup showing the official next-gameweek horizon and missing future files:

![Streamlit transfer recommender page](docs/screenshots/streamlit-transfer-recommender.png)

### 5.2 Optimal Team Page
- Automatically selects the official FPL `is_next` gameweek when that prediction file exists. If live event metadata is unavailable, the app falls back to cached metadata and then to the latest available prediction file.
- Assumes a £100.0m budget (captioned on the page) and displays:
  - Best XI image from `outputs/best_xi_gw<N>.png` (if present).
  - Metrics for expected points (with and without captain), captain, squad confidence, and squad costs.
  - Confidence summary for the whole prediction file: average confidence, average start probability, high-confidence player count, and watchlist volatility.
  - Prediction Confidence Board with the top projected players, confidence level, confidence percentage, start probability, and approximate 80% expected-points range.
  - Tables for starters and bench including  
    `Pos · Name · Team · Opponent · Cost (£m) · Expected CS · Expected A · Expected G · Expected Pts · Confidence · Conf % · Start Prob · 80% Range · Captain · Bench Order`.

### 5.3 Team Comparison Page
- Uses the same upcoming GW predictions.
- Team input methods:
  1. **Use saved team** – reuse the squad cached during the current session.
  2. **Load via FPL ID** – supply your FPL team ID; the app calls `https://fantasy.premierleague.com/api/entry/<id>/event/<last_finished_gw>/picks/` and infers captaincy automatically.
  3. **Upload CSV** – requires `player_id`; optional columns `full_name`, `starting`, `bench`, `captain` are honoured.
  4. **Build interactively** – choose players position-by-position inside the app.
- Displays:
  - Expected points for your squad vs. optimal, points gap, rating percentage.
  - Confidence fields for selected players when present in the prediction file.
  - Actual totals from the last finished GW for both teams (when historical data is present).
  - Tables with the same enriched columns listed above.
- Every submission updates session state, making the squad available to the Transfer Recommender without re-uploading.

### 5.4 Transfer Recommender Page
- Horizon selector defaults to four gameweeks (or fewer if limited prediction files exist).
- Multi-gameweek horizons start from the same official next-gameweek selector used by the Optimal Team and Team Comparison pages.
- Missing prediction files are listed explicitly so stale or incomplete future projections are visible.
- Team inputs mirror Team Comparison (saved team, FPL ID, CSV, interactive builder).
- Parameters:
  - Free transfers available.
  - Maximum transfers to suggest (capped by free transfers by default).
- Output:
  - Recommended swaps (position-aware) with expected points delta.
  - Metrics for transfers suggested, free transfers used, additional hits, and “Optimal projected points with transfers” across the selected horizon.
  - Projection tables for:
    1. Current squad.
    2. Squad after applying recommended transfers.
    3. Optimal squad over the same horizon.
  - Confidence level, confidence percentage, and start probability for players where the first gameweek in the horizon provides those fields.

### 5.5 Player Comparison Lab
- Multi-player selector combines upcoming prediction horizons with historic stats to show players in context.
- Projection summary table highlights total expected points across the chosen gameweek window plus average expected points per GW.
- Skill radar charts plot `expected_goals_per_90`, `expected_assists_per_90`, `clean_sheets_per_90`, and average expected points so you can see complementary profiles at a glance.
- Expected vs. actual scatter graphs surface calibration gaps for any finished gameweek.
- Gameweek timelines track expected points per player across the horizon, alongside a fixture difficulty table that colours upcoming opponents by strength.

#### Notes on FPL ID Usage
- Find your ID in the FPL website URL (`/entry/<id>/`).
- Picks must exist for the last finished GW; otherwise the API returns an error surfaced by the app.
- Session cache stores `(FPL ID, gameweek)` pairs to avoid redundant HTTP calls during a session.

---

## 6. Configuration Highlights

- `config.py` contains most knobs:
  - **Paths** (`RAW_DIR`, `OUTPUTS_DIR`, etc.)
  - **Historical depth** (`PLAYER_HISTORY_SEASONS_BACK`, `EXTERNAL_HISTORY_SEASONS`)
  - **Model tuning** (`ENABLE_HYPERPARAM_TUNING`, distributions)
  - **Bias behaviour** (`EMA_ALPHA`, ability to clamp in `state.py`)
  - **Optimization constraints** (budget, formations, positional limits)
  - **GPU usage** (`ENABLE_GPU_TRAINING`)
- Update those constants directly in `config.py`, or layer your own environment-variable handling around it if you need runtime overrides.
- Removing `models/state.json` resets all stored biases; otherwise the EMA continues from previous runs.

---

## 7. Development Tips & Troubleshooting

- Use `main.py` as the orchestrator; modules are decoupled enough to run individually for testing (e.g., call `features.build_training_and_pred_frames` in notebooks).
- Add unit tests for feature calculations or optimization constraints as the codebase evolves.
- Watch the logs:
  - Selected models and hyperparameters.
  - Bias updates (number of residuals applied).
  - Squad selection metrics and constraints.
- If projections look unrealistic, inspect:
  - The selected gameweek in Streamlit. The app should show the official FPL `is_next` gameweek; cached event metadata refreshes every five minutes and falls back to local `data/raw/bootstrap-static.json` when offline.
  - `fixture_multiplier` in `outputs/predictions_gw*.csv`; double-gameweek teams receive a multiplier greater than 1.0.
  - `models/state.json` for runaway biases.
  - `outputs/residuals_gw*.csv` for large residuals that feed the EMA.
  - Feature importances via the log entries from `log_model_feature_weights`.
- **Streamlit reload** – `streamlit run streamlit_app.py` hot-reloads code changes and respects cached squad selections in session state.
- **Missing projections** – ensure horizon files exist (rerun the pipeline with overrides). The Transfer Recommender lists missing future gameweeks directly.
- **FPL API errors** – confirm the FPL ID is correct and that the last finished GW has recorded picks.

---

## 8. Team Analysis & Programmatic APIs

- `fplmodel.team_analysis` introduces helpers to summarise a user squad and compare it against the optimizer’s recommended XI. Use `compare_team_to_optimal` when you have the model predictions for a given gameweek alongside the user’s roster.
- `fplmodel.transfer_recommender` aggregates predictions across upcoming gameweeks and proposes transfer moves that close the gap to the optimal squad while respecting the available free transfers. The Streamlit page showcases these utilities, but you can import the same functions in scripts or notebooks.
